# Welcome to the animal traits database

The animal traits database is a curated database containing 
body mass, metabolic rate and brain size measurements across a wide range of terrestrial animal taxa. It is described in detail in the (as yet unpublished) publication

Herberstein, M. E. et al. 2021. An animal trait database for body mass, metabolic rate and brain size

The distinctive value of this new animal trait database is four-fold: 
1. Open access: the data are openly available to researchers without restrictions; 
1. Taxonomic breadth: the database includes a broad taxonomic range of terrestrial animal species including several groups of tetrapods and arthropods, as well as molluscs and annelids; 
1. Clean, empirical data: all data are sourced from the original publication that made and reported on the included measurements, and are entered into the database using the original metrics â€“ all subsequent transformations can be applied to these original data, meaning it is eminently reusable by future researchers; 
1. Annotation: we have included useful methodological metadata that allow researchers to filter the dataset as needed.
