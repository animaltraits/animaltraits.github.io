Steps to create a new release

1. On Zenodo, locate the animal traits archive (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5565641) and click on "New version".
3. Save the new revision to reserve a DOI. After saving, scroll down to the field Digital Object Identifier to find the new DOI.
4. Update URLs in docs/_config.yml. In each URL, edit ID in "record/<ID>/files" to be the last component in the new Zenodo DOI, i.e. if the Zenodo DOI is "10.5281/zenodo.6233982", the record ID is 6233982.
5. Save, commit and push all changes to GitHub
6. Create a release on GitHub
7. Download the release ZIP file
8. Upload the ZIP file, observations.csv, column-documentation.csv, observations.xlsx and LICENSE to the Zenodo revision.
9. Save and publish the Zenodo revision.
10. Update the DOI badge in the main README.md. Clicking on the badge in the Zenodo page pops up a dialog with source code for the badge.



Note: do NOT set up the Zenodo/GitHub integration, because it doesn't allow the observations files to be added to the archive outside of the zip file.
