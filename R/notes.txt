Blackr magic behaviour

Step 1: check and standardise raw data

Need R code to read a set of CSV files containing obervations, and output a single(?) CSV file containing merged observations, one row per species?.
Selected traits and units and normalisation?

Metabolic rate normalisation

Steps to standardise whole-body metabolic rate
1. If only mass-specific MR is available,
     divide mass-specific MR by body mass
2. If expressed as consumption of CO2, 
     if respiratory quotient (RQ) is reported
       convert to O2 = CO2 / respiratory quotient
     else if direct conversion factor is provided
       convert to Joules using provided conversion factor
3. If expressed as consumption of O2, 
    convert to Joules using conversion factor e.g. 20 J/mL
4. Convert to desired output units
5. If species is non-endotherm, 
    convert to standard temperature
