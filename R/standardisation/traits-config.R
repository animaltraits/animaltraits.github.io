# Defines traits and conversions used for standardising raw observations

# Various metabolic rate conversions as used in Makarieva (2008)

CONVERSIONS$O2ToJoules <- set_units(20, "J/ml")

# Note that respiratory quotient, for converting between volume of CO2
# production and O2 consumption, is not defined in here, because it depends on
# the metabolism in question, so there is no suitable single value. We only
# perform the conversion if the data source defines the appropriate respiratory
# quotient, and it has been recorded in the raw data file

# Molar mass for converting from moles to mass
